# Python (programming language)

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.Python is dynamically type-checked (Dynamic typing : Types are checked at runtime ,will check the type only when it needs to use it) and garbage-collected (Python automatically manages memory) .

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured.object-oriented and functional programming.


## Datatypes

### Primitive Datatypes

simple values of data.are typically immutable, meaning their value cannot change after they are created.for storing single values and performing basic operations. In Python, all data values are objects. That means Python has no primitive data types and all the types are reference types. However, Python has built-in data types.
python has four primitive variable types:

 1.Integers
 2.Float
 3.Strings
 4.Boolean
