# Graph 
##  What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a data structure used to represent relationships (connections) between objects.

* A graph is made up of:

  * **Vertices (nodes):** The entities (e.g., people, cities, computers).
  * **Edges (links):** The connections/relationships between nodes.

 Example:
In a social network graph:

* Nodes = users
* Edges = friendships/follows

##  Why Graphs Are Important

Graphs are used whenever **relationships** or **connections** matter. They let us:

1. **Model real-world systems** (people, computers, cities, molecules).
2. **Search efficiently** (shortest paths, recommendations).
3. **Discover patterns** (communities, influence, fraud).

##  Uses of Graphs in Different Fields

### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI & Machine Learning)**

Graphs model **knowledge and reasoning**.

* **Knowledge Graphs (Google, ChatGPT, etc.):**
  Store facts in a graph form:

  * Node: “Einstein”
  * Node: “Theory of Relativity”
  * Edge: “developed”

   Used in AI for answering questions, reasoning, and recommendations.
  Example: “Who developed the theory of relativity?” → Follow edges.

* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**
  A type of deep learning where input is a graph.
   Used in **drug discovery**, **fraud detection**, **recommendations**, etc.

### 2. **Network Routing (Internet, Telecom, GPS)**

The internet and GPS maps are basically graphs.

* Nodes = routers/computers/cities
* Edges = cables/links/roads

Algorithms like:

* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Finds shortest path (used in Google Maps).
* **Bellman-Ford / A* search:*\* Handles weights, costs, or heuristics.

 Example:

* When you type a destination in Google Maps → graph search finds the fastest route.
* Internet routing (TCP/IP, OSPF, BGP protocols) → routers exchange graph information and pick the shortest path to send data packets.

---

### 3. **Social Networks (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)**

Social networks are **huge graphs**.

* Node = person
* Edge = friendship/follow/connection

Uses:

* **Friend recommendations (“People you may know”)** → Graph traversal + common neighbors.
* **Influence detection** → Finding highly connected nodes (influencers).
* **Community detection** → Clustering algorithms (find groups with strong internal connections).
* **Content ranking** → Graph-based PageRank (Google originally ranked pages this way).

---

### 4. **Other Important Fields**

* **Biology & Medicine:** Protein interaction networks, brain neural networks.
* **Transportation:** Airports and flights (Airline route optimization).
* **Recommendation Systems:** Amazon/Netflix use graph-based algorithms to recommend items.
* **Cybersecurity:** Fraud detection, intrusion detection, anomaly spotting via graph patterns.

## 🔹 How Graphs Are Used in Practice

* **Representation in code:**

  * **Adjacency Matrix** (2D array) → Fast lookup, but memory heavy.
  * **Adjacency List** (dictionary/list of neighbors) → Memory efficient, common in real apps.

* **Algorithms commonly applied:**

  * BFS & DFS → traversing/searching.
  * Dijkstra & A\* → shortest path.
  * Kruskal & Prim → minimum spanning tree (network design).
  * PageRank → ranking nodes.
  * Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) → AI learning on graph-structured data.

---

**Summary:**
Graphs are everywhere — they model **connections**.

* In **AI**, they store knowledge & power GNNs.
* In **networking**, they help find shortest/optimal routes.
* In **social networks**, they represent people & relationships for recommendations, ranking, and influence.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        if u not in self.graph:
            self.graph[u] = []
        if v not in self.graph:
            self.graph[v] = []
        self.graph[u].append(v)
        self.graph[v].append(u)  # undirected

    def show_graph(self):
        for node in self.graph:
            print(node, "->", self.graph[node])

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]   # simple list used as queue
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)   # remove first element
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=" ")
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node])

def dfs(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    if node not in visited:
        print(node, end=" ")
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)


# ---------- Example ----------
g = Graph()
g.add_edge("A", "B")
g.add_edge("A", "C")
g.add_edge("B", "D")
g.add_edge("C", "D")

print("Graph:")
g.show_graph()

print("\nBFS Traversal:")
bfs(g.graph, "A")

print("\nDFS Traversal:")
dfs(g.graph, "A")
```
